= Private Wiki

Plugin for Redmine project.
Adds ability to mark wiki pages as private (like "private issue" functionality, but for wiki pages)

*Installation* *notes*

I'm not sure about compatibility with redmine versions earlier than 1.3. Maybe it works, maybe not.

- Copy files to vendor/plugins/redmine_private_wiki
- run rake db:migrate_plugins

Feel free to report bugs or send suggestions!
